Relx
=======

Relx is a library that assembles Erlang/OTP releases. Given a release
specification and a list of directories in which to search for OTP
applications it will generate a release output.

It is generally used through the Erlang/OTP build tool
[epm](https://erl.pm/) which provides a cli interface.

Documentation
-----------

`relx` is a library used by [epm](https://erl.pm/). Documentation on
using `epm` for building releases with `relx` can be found on
[erl.pm](https://www.erldoc.com/docs/deployment/releases/).

Also see [Adopting Erlang's Releases
chapter](https://adoptingerlang.org/docs/production/releases/).


Building and Testing
--------

Common Test suites can be run with `epm`:

``` shell
$ epm compile
$ epm ct
```

Tests for the start scripts that are generated by `relx` are tested with
[shelltestrunner](https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner/).

The script `shelltests/run_tests.sh` will clone `epm` master and build it
with the current `relx` as a checkout dependency and then run the tests using
that `epm` escript:

``` shell
$ shelltests/run_tests.sh
```
